INTRODUCTION:

Our project for developing a smart food detector has been reviewed.

This project presents detection of spoiled food using sensor and a buzzer, when food is spoiled the sensor will sense the gases released from food and gives buzzer sound indicating that the food is spoiled and a message will be displayed on lcd that "food spoiled" if spoiled food is brought near sensor or "not spoiled" will be displyed if a fresh food is brought near the sensor.
In the era of technology advancement, everything requires monitoring and controlling, this project represents the detection of contaminated food due to surrounding conditions, storage and transportation. The work done is in terms of the sensed value that have been recorded and a detailed analysis has been performed. 
The arduino gas sensors are able to detect gas emissions from food items even before the presence of any visible signs of spoilage. Using sensors to detect the presence of these gases among foods can help detect spoilage early and prevent consumption of spoiled food. 
When a food item/fruit is brought near the MQ3 sensor, the sensor detects the emission of ethanol type of gases from the food and if the food/fruits get spoiled, it will emit the ethanol type of gases. The MQ3 sensor detects the concentration of such gases and output the signal through buzzer.
The Arduino collects data from the sensors and convert the values to the strings. The sensor data wrapped as proper strings are passed to the character LCD for display.
